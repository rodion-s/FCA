# FCA
Formula Constructing Algorithm for interpretable text classification

Demo code for Formula Constructing Algorithm (FCA).

FCA constructs a representation of a text topic in the form of a Boolean formula â€“ in fact, a request to a full-text information system. The algorithm is based on an optimized selection of various logical predicates with words and terms from the thesaurus.
